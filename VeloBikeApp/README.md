## Questions:

- ### edit `User` (fill all fields: `name`, `age`, `male`, ... !!!
- send `user (email, name, age, ...)` to page "editMe.html" 
and show these data in input form.
- auto change of field `imt` if your enter weight 
and height on this page.
- `editMe.html` don't update information about user, why ???
(It's create new user with new `ID` 
or delete all fields (ever password) except email)
- recalculation of the index `imt` just when filling out the form
